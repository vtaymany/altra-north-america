I always wanted to be the best at what I did. I wanted to win.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I was a wrestler as a kid, and a good one too. Then, at age 22 I received my first &quot;blade,” which&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;a new world of running to me. I even competed at several Para-level track meets between 2008-2014,&nbsp;attempting to make the Paralympic team. I never even came close.&nbsp;In my frustration of not being able to “make the team,” not being able to win, I just thought that running was over for me. I wasn’t good enough. It was simply not meant to be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As my athletic career derailed, so did many other things in my 20s. I had a life that on paper must have looked great, but inside I felt directionless: I didn’t know who or what I wanted to be,&nbsp;but I knew I needed to find out. I dropped all my athletic goals,&nbsp;and shortly after taking one of my last steps on a track I left Kansas City,&nbsp;where I had lived all my life,&nbsp;and moved to Philadelphia to nanny two&nbsp;young girls who had just lost their mother. The experience was life-changing, but when the school year was up, I knew I had to keep moving and searching...which is how I found myself working on a farm, deep in the mountains of Humboldt County, California several months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The work I did on that farm challenged my body in ways I hadn’t ever considered and maybe never thought possible before that. I began to use my body differently:&nbsp;less&nbsp;to be an elite athlete,&nbsp;and more&nbsp;as a means to&nbsp;survive. I dusted off the old track blade and begin running around those mountain hills,&nbsp;and as I&nbsp;did,&nbsp;I started to understand what it was like to move in my body without a goal of making some sort of team or satisfying my ego.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This bodywork changed the way I physically and energetically inhabited my body,&nbsp;and for the first time in my life I felt like I could really MOVE with ease, without pain, and without inhibition. I started running on beaches, trails, streets, everywhere...and broke all my prosthetics in this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the first time in my life, I understood what it&nbsp;really&nbsp;meant to&nbsp;not&nbsp;have the ability to physically move.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It was in this moment that my own past experiences and my future goals came into focus. Movement is not about winning. It is about living. At 22, I thought my worth was defined by medals and championships and accolades. Sitting on a Mendocino beach, looking down at yet another broken prosthetic leg a decade later I almost had to laugh: all I REALLY needed was reliable leg tech, a trail, and the clarity to be grateful for the abundance I had all around me in my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It’s now 2021 and&nbsp;I recently&nbsp;ran my first Ultramarathon in Utah. I&nbsp;DNF’d&nbsp;at 24.4 miles and it was honestly THE BEST RUN OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. 15 years ago, I know I would have felt differently, thinking that not crossing that finish line was somehow a failure. But these days running is something I do for me, to explore my own limits and hopefully inspire others as I move through the trail and the world. I am also working on my nonprofit Mendocino Movement Project, to support people of all abilities, limbs, and levels to get out there and move. I can’t wait to see how far we can go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And in the meantime, there are more ultra-races on my horizon, like the Lake Sonoma 50-miler later this year,&nbsp;and many in between. I have a bad-ass Team USA running coach, awesome sponsors, an unbelievable prosthetics team, my support crew of friends and loved ones around me, and I’m doing what I love. Every day I get to wake up and run IS a win all on its own. And that feels pretty good to me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can see the miles of trails Zachary covers on his Instagram account:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/zachary_movement\">@zachary_movement</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
