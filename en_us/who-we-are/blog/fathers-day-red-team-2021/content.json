Team Member</b>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My identity is deeply rooted in being both a father and a runner. They are two roles I take great pride&nbsp;in yet&nbsp;are also one in the same. Lessons I learn from one often apply to the other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As a father and runner, it opens so many opportunities to connect and set a good example. My kids love to run with&nbsp;me,&nbsp;and they get to witness my 4am&nbsp;wakeups&nbsp;for&nbsp;training, discipline to make healthy food choices, and prioritize good habits such as adequate rest. They see the commitment, consistency, the trials, and the fruits&nbsp;of my labor when everything comes together in a race. In a way, they share in&nbsp;those “personal” victories of PRs and goal achievements&nbsp;and&nbsp;how to process and grow from failed attempts. They also get to be a part of the local tribes and community of&nbsp;like-minded&nbsp;runners, striving to be their best. They observe a powerful process and can make applications to aspects of their own lives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In this picture, I ran a solo 50-miler, during the pandemic, on Halloween 2020. My kids dressed up and provided aid and shared some miles with me. My oldest, Hunter, even dressed up as me—a sponsored Altra Athlete! My&nbsp;4-year-old, Trek, says, “I’m fast, just like daddy!”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The beauty lies within the legacy being built for generations to come. Running isn’t just a hobby in our household. As a full-time coach, it isn’t just a profession either, but a lifestyle that leverages a healthy vehicle to reach personal and spiritual growth as a family. Nothing brings me more honor&nbsp;than&nbsp;to see them live out the values I attempt to exemplify as their father!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Team Member</b>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I have looked forward to running with my kids ever since I started running. Most recently I was able to run a local 5k which included a fun run&nbsp;for kids. My son was hesitant and afraid to run until he saw the trophy that&nbsp;Dad would&nbsp;get,&nbsp;and he wanted to&nbsp;earn&nbsp;an award too. I got the opportunity to line up with him, cheer him on through his first race,&nbsp;and watch him get that medal. To see him light up with excitement made my day and has been the highlight of all my running.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Running teaches us more about ourselves and life than almost anything else.&nbsp;That is what I want to share with my kids. I want them to learn that if they want something, they can work hard, go for it, and accomplish more than they ever imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Life isn't lived from one medal or trophy to the next but the lessons we learn in the middle of those pursuits. It was awesome watching my son conquer his fear and going after something he really wanted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Running has become a common point and mutual outlet for us as she's grown. It has afforded us the opportunity to chase goals as she now competes and I'm able to coach. It has provided an avenue to learn about perseverance and pushing ourselves through tough times. Most importantly, it has provided us with our own &quot;it&quot; when we need to reboot and reset. I've learned that there's not much you can't work through when out for a good run. It may take two...but I’m not complaining. I'll take all the time I can get with her. That's the beauty of lacing up and heading out the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The memories that the miles have provided are priceless. I wouldn’t trade them for the world.

Most of our running is recreational, though we have done a few family 5Ks. I think he appreciates being on the trails more than the roads—something about trees and dirt. On the roads, he’s more likely to bike along while I run.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A lot of my running has been&nbsp;driven by&nbsp;an effort to be healthier, both for myself and for my family. I hope to spark an interest in him in being active, healthy, and outdoors, whatever he gets into—and for him to know that he&nbsp;is capable of pushing&nbsp;beyond challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Of course, I’d love the running bug to bite him too—at least until he really hits his stride and leaves his old man in the dust.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
