My wife, Kami, and I discovered this firsthand when we took our six kids on a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail (AT). In hiking a total of 2,189 miles together, we got a lot of blisters, ate a lot of gummy bears, and learned some of the benefits of empowerment as well as how to do it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Embrace Risk and Let Your Children Fail&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>As parents, we’re taught that part of our duty is to minimize risk for our children. Some of this is innate, as it’s difficult to see your child get hurt or discouraged. And some of it is societal pressure, because we don’t want people to think we’re bad parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you want to empower your kids, though, you need to let them discover their own limits, and that means letting them take risks and fail.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When Kami and I announced our plan to hike the AT, a lot of people told us not to do it. “The AT is no place for kids,” they said. They told us it would be too difficult physically, and there were too many dangers—everything from inclement weather to bears and snakes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There was some truth to the things they said. Hiking the AT was a risk, and anytime you take a risk, there’s a potential cost—namely, failure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But there’s also a cost to&nbsp;not&nbsp;taking risks. This cost can be harder to see, which makes it easy to ignore, but it’s often a far more damaging cost in the long run. When you don’t allow risks, you stunt your child’s growth. You prevent them from rising to their full potential, and you encourage the formation of harmful habits, like always staying in one’s comfort zone or not striving toward big goals for fear of failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

They would have risked little,&nbsp;and also&nbsp;gained little. Instead of having a life-changing experience that helped them grow and learn about their personal strength, they would have played video games and watched TV all day—activities that largely leave us unchanged.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, risk and failure are part of life. You’re not doing your children a favor by shielding them from these realities. You’re actively disempowering them. If you want them to succeed as adults, you must teach them how to manage risks and failures, not how to avoid them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Help Your Kids Find Purpose&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Few things are more empowering than having a purpose. It inspires us and makes us feel valuable. Kids crave purpose, just like adults. They want to contribute to their family, their community, and their world, but they don’t know how.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Instead of helping them to contribute in a meaningful way, we dictate asinine chores. Make your bed. Take out the trash. Fold your clothes. Nothing about these tasks screams essential or valuable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Part of this is simply the nature of modern life, but subconsciously, we often deprive our children of the opportunity to have purpose because we don’t trust them with the important tasks. We don’t want to give them meaningful tasks that have a purpose, because we’re worried—or even assume—that they will do a bad job. It’s easier if we do it ourselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

She could hurt herself, and if she spilled the pot, we’d lose our entire meal and&nbsp;have to&nbsp;go hungry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I told myself the stakes were too high, but really, my trust was too low.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After the first couple of weeks, Kami and I were overwhelmed by trying to do all the “important” tasks ourselves, and we finally began to delegate. We let our sixteen-year-old cook our meals for the rest of the trip, and she absolutely killed it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All of&nbsp;our kids contributed. When we rolled into a campsite, they would start setting up the tent, fetching water, and gathering firewood. We didn’t have to badger them to do these things. They did them because they knew they needed to be done, and they could see the real-world value their actions had.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What we found is, if you give your kids the opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way, they will rise to the occasion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Let Go of Control&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>A few weeks into our hike, we were already falling behind schedule, unable to meet our daily mileage goals. I was the one slowing us down, because I was carrying our two-year-old, Rainier. His pack, at forty-four pounds, was by far the heaviest pack we had. I was carrying him exclusively and losing weight like crazy—close to thirty pounds in the first five weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, about five hundred miles into the hike, in Shenandoah National Park, our oldest asked me, “Can’t you go any faster?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“No, I’m carrying your brother. This is as fast as I can go,” I told her. “If you think it’s so easy, why don’t you do it?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It was meant to be a rhetorical question—a way of shutting down the conversation. My daughter took it as a challenge, though. “Fine,” she said. “I’ll do it.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><i>Great</i>,&nbsp;I thought,&nbsp;<i>she’ll learn her lesson once she realizes how hard this is</i>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It turns out I was the one who needed to learn a lesson. She carried Rainier for the rest of the afternoon without a single complaint, and she did it faster than I could have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
