And even finished close to the bottom on the rope climb.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although I was relatively new to functional fitness, the podium was a familiar sight from competitions I’d seen on tv:&nbsp;Three&nbsp;white dudes with amply developed deltoids and quads.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>John Davis was 17 when he won the Light Heavyweight crown in the 1938 Weightlifting World Championship at Vienna, Austria!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He&nbsp;was born in Smithtown, NY&nbsp;in 1921. He grew up and trained in Brooklyn, NY. But he competed for the York Barbell Club in York, PA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After his premiere on the world stage in 1938, Davis went on to be undefeated in national and international weightlifting completions until 1953!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He competed for the United States and won gold medals in the 1948 and 1952 Olympics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>During his career,&nbsp;he won&nbsp;six&nbsp;world titles, 12 national titles, and set 16 world records:&nbsp;Seven&nbsp;in the Snatch,&nbsp;four&nbsp;in the Clean &amp; Jerk,&nbsp;two in the Press, and&nbsp;two&nbsp;in the Total.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He also became the first ever man to lift over 400&nbsp;pounds&nbsp;when he lifted 402 in the 1951 National Championship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>John Davis enlisted in the US Army during World War 2. His weightlifting accolades could have been even greater if not for competitions being cancelled during the&nbsp;war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>John&nbsp;retired in 1956 after suffering a severe thigh injury in competition.&nbsp;He&nbsp;died from cancer in 1984.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 2013, I was just a year into my Personal Training career. I had left Corporate Banking&nbsp;three&nbsp;years earlier to pursue my passion,&nbsp;although I didn’t yet know what my passion was.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I just knew it didn’t involve me sitting at a desk calculating ways to make money for the sake of making money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In my new mission to help people transform into the best versions of themselves, I wanted to see if I&nbsp;could&nbsp;also train myself to become one of the fittest people on earth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The CrossFit Games were on ESPN and I wanted to be as fit as the guys on tv!&nbsp;But&nbsp;I had a LONG way to go from a strength standpoint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Out of all the athletes at the Games from around the world, only one looked like me:&nbsp;Neal Maddox. A thirty-something&nbsp;year old&nbsp;former football player from California. He never won the title. But he was a consistent presence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At that time, social media as we know it today didn’t exist. Virtual workout programs were&nbsp;non-existent. Instagram didn’t even have video sharing technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So&nbsp;I Googled “black strength champions” to search for some inspiration. I discovered John Davis along the way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to finding his amazing story, I also found excerpts from his training journal. And I based my proper Strength Program on movements, rep schemes, and percentages he used in training throughout his career!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Over the last&nbsp;eight&nbsp;years, I’ve certainly gotten a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;fitter, stronger, and smarter!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While I never personally competed in the CrossFit Games, I went as&nbsp;Coach in 2017 for the 18th Fittest Woman in the 40-44 age group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That year,&nbsp;I also won Men’s Health Magazine’s Fittest Trainer Competition at age 31… just a few weeks after opening my own Gym in Jersey City!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If John Davis was alive&nbsp;today,&nbsp;he would have just celebrated his 100th birthday on January 12th!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While I no longer have ambitions of personally competing at a high level, I am inspired by and draw learnings from John Davis when&nbsp;strength programming for clients and athletes at all fitness levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And today,&nbsp;on any given&nbsp;weightlifting platform, you can witness men, women, boys, and girls of&nbsp;color&nbsp;breaking records, setting new ones, and winning championships across the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rest in Power to John Davis!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><i>About the author:</i>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>André Crews&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;functional&nbsp;fitness&nbsp;athlete and coach, winner of the 2017 Men’s Health Fittest Trainer, and&nbsp;the owner of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.150bay.fit/\">150 Bayfit</a>&nbsp;in Jersey City.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Follow André on Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andrecrews/\">@andrecrews</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n",
