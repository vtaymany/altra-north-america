When we share your personal information with our service providers and contractors, we instruct them to only use or share your personal information for the intended purposes, which are limited to those listed above. One example of our information sharing with a service provider is when we share your name, address, and similar contact information with a courier service for the purpose of delivering a product to you and notifying you of the status of the shipment.  Our service providers and contractors include entities that perform the following activities on our behalf: marketing and advertising; order fulfillment; consumer or market research and analysis; account management; event or promotion management; fraud detection; security; customer service; payment processing; technical support; product creation. The categories of information that we may share with service providers and contractors are the following: Identifiers; Contact information; Profile information; Education information; Employment information; Internet activity; Demographic information; Physical characteristics or biometric information; Financial information; or Location data.  We share these categories of information for the same purposes we collect and use them, as described above under the caption “Why Your Information Is Collected and Used.” &lt;/br>&#xd;&#xa;We may also disclose consumers’ personal information (including sensitive personal information) to third parties who are not our contractors or service providers for the following purposes: (11) to facilitate our merger or acquisition activities; (13) to facilitate internal audits, dispute resolution or investigations; (22) to detect and address actual or potential fraud; or (24) to comply with various legal obligations or other rules to which we are subject. &lt;/br>&#xd;&#xa;We do not sell consumers’ personal information for money.  We do, however, share consumers’ personal information (including sensitive personal information)  with certain third parties in ways that might be considered a “sale” of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act, even though we do not receive any financial compensation from the third parties in exchange.  For example, we allow third parties, such as Facebook® and Google®, to place technologies (such as cookies) on our websites for purposes of marketing to users of our websites.  To request that your personal information not be sold, please follow this hyperlink: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vfc.com/privacy-requests&quot;>Your Privacy Choices&lt;/a>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Data Retention&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>We retain each category of personal information about consumers for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected and used, but not longer.  In determining the period of time consumer personal information will be retained, we consider the frequency with which our consumers purchase from us, our consumer’s experience, the utility of the information to our business objectives, warranty and recall issues, legal and contractual record retention requirements, and other factors. We do not retain any category of personal information for more than six years following our last interaction with a consumer, unless required by law.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Children’s Privacy&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>We do not intend to collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16.

We do not knowingly share or sell the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Keeping Your Personal Information Secure&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>We store personal information on our servers or those of our service providers (including “cloud” servers), and it is accessible by authorized employees, representatives and agents who require access for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. We have implemented reasonable security procedures and measures that are intended to protect personal information and our information technology systems that store personal information. Unfortunately, no transmission of information over the Internet nor storage of information electronically can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. In order to help protect personal information you provide to us, you: (i) should not share your password or account information with others, (ii) should use a secure internet connection and web browser, (iii) should select a unique, complex, secure password, (iv) should change your password frequently, and (v) should not use the same password elsewhere. If you become aware of any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of a password, please contact us immediately using the contact information below.  By providing your email address in connection with a purchase or your use of our websites, mobile applications, or services, you are consenting to receive electronic notice of any information security issues using your most recent email address in our records.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Links To Other Websites&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Our websites and mobile applications may contain links to third-party websites to which this Privacy Statement does not apply (&quot;Linked Websites&quot;). Your use of Linked Websites will be governed by the terms of use, privacy policies, and other terms, notices, and policies set forth on or referenced in those Linked Websites. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Links To Other Websites &lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Our websites and mobile applications may contain links to third-party websites to which this Privacy Statement does not apply (&quot;Linked Websites&quot;). Your use of Linked Websites will be governed by the terms of use, privacy policies, and other terms, notices, and policies set forth on or referenced in those Linked Websites. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>International Data Transfers&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>This Privacy Statement describes our policies and procedures in the United States and Canada. We are a global company, and personal information we collect in the United States and Canada may be transferred to other jurisdictions (such as the United States, Canada, and the European Union) as permitted by law, for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, and the information may become subject to the laws of those jurisdictions and accessible to authorities in those jurisdictions. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Your Options Regarding Personal Information&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>We have established processes by which you or an authorized agent can submit requests regarding your personal information. To exercise your options as described in this Privacy Statement, you may contact us in one of the following ways: &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>by telephone at +1-877-709-1800;&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>by completing the web form at https://www.vfc.com/Privacy-Requests; or&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>by mail at: VF Corporation, Attn: Privacy Officer, 105 Corporate Center Blvd., Greensboro, North Carolina, USA 27408. &lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Collectively, these are referred to as the “Communication Methods.” To effectively exercise your privacy options or inquire about how we handle your personal information, you must use one of these Communication Methods.  You may also send questions or complaints to our Privacy Officer using the above Communication Methods, and we will take appropriate steps to address any legitimate concerns or complaints. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>The list below describes types of requests you may make to us regarding information we have collected from you: &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Know:&lt;/b> You may ask us to furnish you with (i) the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you; (ii) the categories of personal information we have collected about you; (iii) the categories of sources from which we collect information about you; (iv) the business or commercial purposes for collecting information about you; (v) the categories of third parties with whom we share or have shared personal information about you; (vi) the categories of personal information we have shared about you; or (vii) profiling or automated decision-making affecting you.&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Delete:&lt;/b> You may ask us to delete any personal information that we have collected from you and to direct our service providers to delete your personal information from their records.&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Correct:&lt;/b> You may ask us to correct or update your personal information that has been previously provided to us&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Opt-Out of Sale:&lt;/b> You may request that we not sell your personal information.&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Opt-Out of Selling or Sharing of Personal Information:&lt;/b> You may request that we not sell your personal information or share your personal information to third parties for certain purposes.&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising:&lt;/b> You may ask us not to target advertisements to you based on your behavior across contexts. &lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Opt-Out of Sharing for Third-Party Marketing:&lt;/b> You may ask us not to share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties solely for their independent direct marketing purposes (under California’s Shine the Light Law).&lt;/li> &#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Opt-Out of Profiling and Automated Decision-Making:&lt;/b> You may ask us not to use your personal information in profiling or automated decision-making processes.&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Opt-Out of the Use or Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information:&lt;/b> You may ask us not to use your sensitive personal information for certain purposes. &lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;    &lt;li>&lt;b>Request to Opt-In:&lt;/b> After making an opt-out request listed above, you may choose to opt back in.&lt;/li>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your Request to Know, Delete or Correct  within 45 days; however, we may notify you during the initial 30-day period that we will extend the timeframe as permitted by law. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your Request to Opt-Out within 15 days. We reserve the right to deny any request to the extent permitted by applicable law.  We may decline a Request to Delete, in part or in whole, if we determine that there is a lawful basis for retaining the information, including because the information is necessary to (i) complete a transaction or perform a contract between us; (ii) ensure security; (iii) debug or repair errors; (iv) exercise a legal right; (v) comply with another law or a legal obligation; (vi) conduct research; (vii) enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with our consumers’ reasonable expectations; or (viii) otherwise use the information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information. If we deny a request, in whole or in part, we will notify you using the Communication Method you have selected, and we will provide you with instructions on how to appeal the decision.  We will not discriminate against you because you have made a request described in this Privacy Statement or otherwise exercised your rights under applicable law. We may offer financial or non-financial incentives in connection with programs that require you to disclose certain personal information, such as a customer loyalty program, but only if you opt in to such an incentive program. If you ask us to delete your information or limit the use of your information, we will comply with your request, but you may lose some or all of the benefits associated with the incentive program.  (For example, if you ask us to delete your personal information, you will lose any accumulated loyalty program points.)&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Information regarding the consumer privacy requests we received in the prior calendar year is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vfc.com/privacy-requests/vf-corporation-annual-report-of-privacy-requests-in-north-america&quot;>here&lt;/a>.&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>How Your Identity Will Be Verified&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>For your privacy and security, and to prevent fraud and other harmful activities, when we receive a request through one of the Communication Methods, we may need to ensure that the person submitting the request is the person they purport to be. Accordingly, we may take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person submitting the request, as further described in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vfc.com/privacy-requests&quot;>privacy request web portal&lt;/a>. If we ask you to verify your identity, you must promptly cooperate with our efforts so that we can fulfill your request. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Requests from Authorized Agents&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>If you submit a consumer privacy request on behalf of another person, you must verify your legal authority to act on behalf of that person, and your identity and the identity of the other person, to our satisfaction before we can fulfill your request.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>How You Can Opt Out of Online Advertising or Other Promotional Communications&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>In addition to the options described above, you can take other steps to limit the collection, use and sharing of your personal information. You can manage how your device, mobile browser and other devices share information with our websites and mobile apps, as well as how your browser handles cookies and other tracking technologies, by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device. Please refer to instructions provided by your service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings. Our websites currently do not have a mechanism to recognize an Internet browser’s “Do Not Track” signals, and we cannot follow those signals.  Several of the companies that utilize cookies or other tracking or monitoring mechanisms enable you to opt out of advertising through mechanisms established by trade groups. If you wish to reduce this type of third-party, interest-based advertising, you may opt out of advertising from members of the National Advertising Initiative &lt;a href=&quot;https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1&quot;>here&lt;/a>, and from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance &lt;a href=&quot;https://youradchoices.com/&quot;>here&lt;/a> (for US) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://youradchoices.ca/&quot;>here&lt;/a> (for Canada). Please note the links in the prior sentence will not opt you out of receiving all marketing communications from us. There are other ways in which you can tell us whether or not you want to receive promotional communications from us. When you set-up an account or log into your account on our websites or mobile applications, you may have an opportunity to make or change your selections with respect to each brand. You also will have an opportunity to opt-out of advertising email messages from us by clicking on an &quot;unsubscribe&quot; hyperlink contained in commercial e-mails those brands send you. If you receive a text message (SMS or MMS) from one of our brands and would like to opt out of receiving further text messages, you may do so by following the opt-out instructions within the text message.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Changes to This Privacy Statement&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>We will review our Privacy Statement periodically (at least annually), and we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to revise, change or modify this Privacy Statement at any time.  We will post any changes to this Privacy Statement on our websites and they will be effective as of the date of posting. We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review this information. By engaging with us, including by visiting our website(s) or mobile application(s), after this Privacy Statement has been updated, you agree to the updated terms of this Privacy Statement.  This Privacy Statement was last updated on January 1, 2023.&lt;/p>"
