THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION PROVISION SHALL NOT APPLY TO ALTRA’S OWN NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL CONDUCT. &lt;/p>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h4>Compliance with Applicable Laws; Export Control Laws&lt;/h4>&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>This Website is operated, in whole or in part, from the United States. User access to this Website is governed by all applicable federal, state and local laws. All information available on the Website is subject to U.S. export control laws and may also be subject to the laws of the country where you reside. All Altra products and publications are commercial in nature. Altra does not make any representations regarding the legality of access to or use of this Website or the information contained therein from other countries. Access in countries where the information contained herein or the products sold through this website are illegal is prohibited. Users who access this Website from outside of the United States do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable US export and local country laws. By using this Website, regardless of where you live in the world, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed and collected in the United States in compliance with the privacy policy. &lt;/p>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa; &#xd;&#xa;&lt;h4>Disputes and Arbitration Agreement&lt;/h4>&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa; &#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Website and our services, any dealings with us and our customer service agents, any representations made by us, and/or your use of our websites (including without limitation claims relating to the breach of the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual basis.  This includes any dispute or claim you assert against our sister-brands, subsidiaries, affiliates and assigns. This also includes any dispute or claim that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Unless you proceed with a small claims action, the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law will apply. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration WE BOTH HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless we both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, consolidated or class proceeding. If the requirements of this paragraph are found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void except for the waiver of any right to a jury trial described in the previous paragraph. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules, except as provided in this section.  If your total claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person.  The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>If a dispute arises we strongly encourage you to first contact our Customer Service Department before starting arbitration or filing a claim in small claims court. We value our relationships with our customers and will try to resolve your claims informally and quickly. &lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>If your dispute is not resolved by Customer Service, before beginning arbitration, please send written notice describing the claim to the Office of the General Counsel at the following address: &lt;/p>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa; &#xd;&#xa;Altra, a division of VF Outdoor, LLC&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;ATTN: General Counsel&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;2701 Harbor Bay Parkway&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;Alameda, CA 94502&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;Email: altra_customerservice@vfc.com&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa; &#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>If the claim has not been resolved within 30 days of sending the notice you may then commence an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules and forms are available at www.adr.org or by calling 877-495-4185.&lt;/p>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h4>Governing Law; Entire Agreement&lt;/h4>&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, these Terms of Use and any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to our services, these Terms of Use, the &lt;a href=&quot;/privacy-policy.html&quot;>PRIVACY POLICY&lt;/a> your use of the Website, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the State of California, without regard to its choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.S. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Except as otherwise prohibited by law, any claim or dispute must be brought within one (1) year from the date the cause of action arises. Any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to our services, these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy or your use of the Website shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of state or federal courts in San Francisco County or Alameda County, in the State of California and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. If any provision of these Terms of Use are held to be unlawful, or for any reason, unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. These Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Altra with respect to the subject matter of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. &lt;/p>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h4>VF Employees&lt;/h4>&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Please click &lt;a href=&quot;https://altrarunning.com/terms/vf-associate-discount.html&quot;>here&lt;/a> to review the VF employee discount.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;&lt;h4>Contact Us&lt;/h4>&lt;br>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>If you have any questions about these Terms of Use, please contact Customer Service at 1-888-851-9411 or email us at altra_customerservice@vfc.com. &lt;/p>&lt;br>&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;"
